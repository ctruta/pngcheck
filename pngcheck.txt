This version of pngcheck has support for decoding and error checking most
of the known chunk types, with the exception of IDAT and zTXt.  As well,
it also checks for multiple blocks (for those types that are illegal to
have duplicates of), and for correct chunk ordering.

Ver 1.91 also checks for valid cHRM contents, as well as a few minor bug
         fixes.

Ver 1.92 fixes error in cHRM ordering relative to PLTE, also has a -q flag
         to supress output of informational messages, but still prints out
         error messages.
