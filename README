pngcheck version 1.99-grr1 of 13 June 1999

This semi-official version of pngcheck contains several enhancements beyond
the stock version 1.98:  zlib capability (to be able to print out the line
filters for each line of the image); information on the compression factor
of the image (expressed as a percentage, where 0% is no compression and 100%
would be total compression); extended support for printing palettes (includes
transparency info and histograms now); partial support for MNG streams con-
forming to Draft 64; and support for MSVC compilation under Win32.  It also
contains a fix from Tom Lane for a bug in the pHYs-reporting code.

Improved support for MNG is coming this summer, but I won't make any promises
as to when.  Maybe during a lunch hour or three one of these days.... :-)
Support for EBCDIC-based systems and for DOS/Win32 wildcards is on the way,
too.
